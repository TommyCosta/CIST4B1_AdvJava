# CIST4B1_AdvJava
Advanced Python - Data Structures

About Me:
My name is Tommy Costa and I live in the bay are near San Francisco. I have been coding for three years, mostly learned through professional experience. I worked over two years on the technical support team for a SaaS company, where I learned how to search databases using SQL. In that position, I also worked with Python programs and simple Java scripts, but did not actually write them. I took a genuine interest to the world of software engineering and decided to go back to school to expand my skillset. I have now cpmpleted two Python and one Java course (this is my second). In the past few months I have been working as part of a QE team for a networking company, though my role as lab associate is not very hands on.

Goals:
By completeing this course, I hope to deepen my understanding of databases and how to build them efficently. It's been two semesters since I have taken a Java course, so reinforcing that language wil also be nice. Personal growth is the personal goal, but this course also leads to a potential degree someday.
