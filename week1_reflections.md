What I've learned about data structures so far in this course is the importance of the range in time and space efficentcy between them. It is important to be able to distinguish which database will be the best solution for a particular problem because in future job interviews, the person with the best solution will get the job. Those solutions can come in many different forms, but being able to pinpoint a priority on time or space allows for better planning.
